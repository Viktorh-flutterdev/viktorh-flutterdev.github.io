TaskMaster
TaskMaster is a cross-platform task management mobile application built with Flutter and Dart, designed to help users organize tasks efficiently with local storage support. This project showcases my skills in Flutter development and responsive UI design.
üìã Project Overview
TaskMaster allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks seamlessly across iOS and Android devices. With a clean and intuitive UI, it uses local storage (SharedPreferences) to persist tasks, making it a lightweight yet functional app. This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate Flutter expertise.
